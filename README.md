# 🧾 InvoiceGenius – Smart Invoice & Receipt Parser (GraphQL Edition)

**ALX ProDev Backend – Project Nexus**  
**Repository:** `alx-invoicegenius-graphql`  
**Author:** [Shymaa M Ismail]  
**Track:** AI, OCR, Django and GraphQL API Development

---

## 📌 Overview

**InvoiceGenius** is a smart backend system that enables users to upload receipts or invoices in PDF or image format, then intelligently extracts structured fields (like vendor name, date, tax, and total amount) using **OCR** and **OpenAI's GPT**.  

The application exposes a modern, flexible **GraphQL API** using **Graphene-Django**, with background task processing via **Celery** and **Redis**.

This project showcases real-world backend engineering with asynchronous processing, AI integration, token authentication, and best practices in modern backend development.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- 📊 Automate invoice parsing using OCR + LLMs
- 🌐 Provide GraphQL APIs for interacting with invoice data
- 🧵 Handle long-running tasks using Celery
- 🔒 Secure file upload and user-specific data access
- 💡 Demonstrate professional, production-level backend architecture

## 🗃️ ERD & Data Models

📌 [Link to ERD Diagram](https://link-to-your-erd)

- **User**
- **InvoiceFile**: Holds uploaded files and metadata
- **ParsedInvoice**: Stores extracted fields like `vendor`, `date`, `subtotal`, `total`, `tax`

## 🚀 Example GraphQL Operations

### Upload an Invoice
```graphql
mutation {
  uploadInvoice(file: Upload!) {
    invoiceFile {
      id
      filename
      status
    }
  }
}
```

### Fetch Parsed Results
```graphql
query {
  myInvoices {
    id
    fileUrl
    status
    parsedData {
      vendor
      invoiceDate
      tax
      total
    }
  }
}
```

### Authenticate (Token)
```graphql
mutation {
  tokenAuth(username: "user", password: "pass") {
    token
  }
}
```

## 🛠 Installation & Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShymaaIsmail/invoicegenius-graphql.git
cd invoicegenius-graphql

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

cp .env.example .env  # Add keys: OPENAI_API_KEY, REDIS_URL, etc.

python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
python manage.py runserver

# In a new terminal (for background worker)
celery -A invoicegenius worker -l info
```

---

## 📚 Best Practices Applied

- Modular Django app structure
- Environment separation using `.env`
- GraphQL schema introspection enabled
- Async task queuing for performance
- Secure file upload & validation
- Token-based authentication
- Field validation and prompt engineering for reliable parsing
- Swagger/Postman setup for non-GraphQL routes (e.g., auth)
